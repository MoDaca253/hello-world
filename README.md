The Modaca Effect

Hello, my name for these purposes will be MoDaca until I do something brilliant. I am new to software development, and I hope to learn fairly quickly the basics, so I can be of more assistance when it comes to contributing to the projects we'll be working on via Free Code Camp. Anyways, I hope to learn from you as much, or more than you hope to learn from others as we all work togther. 

So, Let's get to it! :)
